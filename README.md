# wimg

I have some file naming conventions that I use for saving wallpaper images.
The file names that I choose to use include the image width and height but it
is kind of tedious to do manually. Why do it manually when a computer can do it
for you?

## Example

```
$ wimg -name="google now mountains" https://i.imgur.com/UfCjC8q.jpg
  => ~/img/1920x1080_google_now_mountains.jpg
```
